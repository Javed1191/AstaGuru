      "Profile": "Born in 1887 in a remote village in the state of West Bengal, Jamini Roy studied at Kolkata’s Government School of Art. Initially, he painted in particular, in the Post-Impressionist genre essentially of portraits and landscapes, in keeping with his grooming as part of a proper British academic system.<br><br> \r\nBy 1925 though, he started to experiment along the lines of the then popular bazaar paintings synonymous with the Kalighat temple. By the 1930s, he almost completely switched over to indigenous materials for painting on woven mats, wood coated with lime and cloths. The motivation to paint on woven mats was the textures the artist noticed in Byzantine art that he had observed in color photos.<br><br> \r\nThe Santhal tribe in West Bengal’s rural districts formed an important subject matter for him. A series of works that he did was a perfect example of the way he fathomed the qualities, an integral aspect of native folk art and blended the same with his own style. His fusing of elements of tribal art (terracotta work in a temple in Bengal) with the minimal brushstrokes of the popular Kalighat style gave rise to a unique blend. <br><br>The artist's firm rejection of the prevailing modern style of painting coupled with his foray into the folk paintings of Bengal was an important development in Indian modern art. He painted forms and figures like the Christ, the mother and child etc in two-dimensional forms, with an emphasis on the lines and flat color application. The subjects, laced with decorative borders and motifs in the background, were mesmerizing.<br><br> \r\nJamini Roy’s works were showcased as part of several solo and group shows in India and internationally. Honored with the Padma Bhushan award in 1955, the artist died in 1972.\r\n",

      "Profile": "Born in 1887 in a remote village in the state of West Bengal, Jamini Roy studied at Kolkata’s Government School of Art. Initially, he painted in particular, in the Post-Impressionist genre essentially of portraits and landscapes, in keeping with his grooming as part of a proper British academic system.<br><br> \r\nBy 1925 though, he started to experiment along the lines of the then popular bazaar paintings synonymous with the Kalighat temple. By the 1930s, he almost completely switched over to indigenous materials for painting on woven mats, wood coated with lime and cloths. The motivation to paint on woven mats was the textures the artist noticed in Byzantine art that he had observed in color photos.<br><br> \r\nThe Santhal tribe in West Bengal’s rural districts formed an important subject matter for him. A series of works that he did was a perfect example of the way he fathomed the qualities, an integral aspect of native folk art and blended the same with his own style. His fusing of elements of tribal art (terracotta work in a temple in Bengal) with the minimal brushstrokes of the popular Kalighat style gave rise to a unique blend. <br><br>The artist's firm rejection of the prevailing modern style of painting coupled with his foray into the folk paintings of Bengal was an important development in Indian modern art. He painted forms and figures like the Christ, the mother and child etc in two-dimensional forms, with an emphasis on the lines and flat color application. The subjects, laced with decorative borders and motifs in the background, were mesmerizing.<br><br> \r\nJamini Roy’s works were showcased as part of several solo and group shows in India and internationally. Honored with the Padma Bhushan award in 1955, the artist died in 1972.\r\n",

      "Profile": "Born in 1913 in Budapest, Amrita Sher-Gil was undoubtedly the first significant woman artist from India to attain fame internationally in the 1930s. One of India’s most significant artists, her extensive oeuvre is a unique blend of sharp commentary on the prevailing socio-cultural milieu and the philosophy of painting. Mere 29 years of life and awe-inspiring artistic achievements therein still evoke immense curiosity among art connoisseurs. Ironically, she could enjoy limited success and recognition, as an artist in her lifetime.<br><br>\r\nThis painter with extraordinary got her early lessons in art in Florence, and later joined the Ecole des Beaux Arts, in Paris. Her early works reflected the academic style she was trained in. She simultaneously experimented to represent the non-western body in her paintings. Amrita Sher-Gil was an admirer of artist Paul Gauguin whose influence was palpable in some of her works. Later her practice moved towards the melancholy, even while eyes firmly fixed on the timelessness of a pretty object.<br><br>\r\nMany of her paintings in the early 1930s in the European style included several self portraits, apart from paintings of her life in Paris, still life studied, nude studies, and portraits of her friends. The self portraits captured the own persona in many moods, revealing a curious streak in her personality. The artist also yearned for her home country, and her roots. She came back home in 1934. She appropriated in particular the language of miniatures.<br><br> \r\nHer female protagonists, often portrayed in their own secluded private spaces, were mostly from humble backgrounds. The legendary artist died at the age of 29 in 1941 in Lahore.",

Being greatly influenced by Japanese artist Yokoyama\r\nTaikan, his works carried a Japanese stamp. He is best known for his\r\npolitical cartoons and social satires on Westernized Bengalis. His\r\nwork was exhibited in the 22nd exhibition de Societe des peintres\r\norientalistes francais (1914) in Paris, London, Belgium and Holland,\r\nand in a travelling exhibition organised by the American Federation\r\nof Art and ISOA (1924) in London and Germany, and he exhibited in\r\nthe Athene Gallery in Geneva in 1928.\r\nGagendranath died in Kolkata in 1938.",

He was a modernist for whom the form\r\nand language of art preceded all other social and political\r\nmotivations. His art was intuitive, spontaneous and improvised, and\r\nnot deliberate or intellectual, intended on finding expression which\r\nled to a peculiar eclecticism. He was the first contemporary Indian\r\npainter to incessantly use the female nude as a muse and artistic\r\nsubject while remaining within the constraints of naturalism.\r\nAra dedicated the prime of his career to painting nudes and stilllifes,\r\njuxtaposing the two in a manner of an artistic sleight-of hand.\r\nHe always stayed clear of the acceptable, the ordinary, and just as his\r\nPAG counterparts did and preached. There was a marked steering\r\naway from opprobrium and an attempt to arrive at a style in which\r\nan impression of the subject was more important than an actual\r\nrepresentation. The body is well fleshed out with strong outlines in\r\nplaces with an expressionistic reference. He renders the nude in a\r\nWestern master’s style for whom the delights of the nude lay in their\r\nwanton voluptuousness. She is completely unrestrained with a\r\nrevealing face and calmness in her posture.",

In its internationalist mood, this generation looked to the early 20th-century modernisms of Paris, London and Vienna for inspiration; its need to belong prompted an interest in the construction of a viable ‘Indian’ aesthetic that bore a dynamic relationship to an Indian identity. With Ram Kumar, this quest for an indigenist tenor has not meant a superficial inventory of ‘native’ motifs offered as evidence of a static and essentialist Indian identity. Instead, as I have already suggested, he demonstrates that a painter can enact the innermost dramas of his culture while maintaining the individuality, even idiosyncrasy of his performance. \r\nExcerpts from \"Parts of a World: Reflections on the Art of Ram Kumar\" by Ranjit Hoskote, 2002<br><br>\r\nRam Kumar lives and works from Delhi",

      "Profile": "One of the post-independence India’s significant abstract expressionist painters, Hari Ambadas Gade was also among founders of the Progressive Art movement. He opted for an unconventional style, and rebelled against the set norms of academic art, imposed by the British education system, as most PAG members did at that time.<br><br>\r\nBorn in Amravati in the state of Maharashtra in 1916, he did his graduation (science), though he was fond of drawing since childhood. He came in touch with SH Raza, who provided him with precious inputs. The talented artist started off by primarily painting watercolors. However, he gradually switched to painting oils on canvas. Gade made use of the palette knife as well as brush to finish his paintings. <br><br>\r\nGade had his exhibition in Mumbai in 1947, and a year later at the annual Bombay Art Society show. He was invited for a show in Paris, and at Stanford University in 1949. His works were exhibited at the prestigious Venice Biennale in 1954. As several art critics have rightly pointed out,  his art practice stands on a solid intellectual platform and his works reflect a unique streak, wherein color is of great importance, and form happens to be only incidental. <br><br>\r\nThe young artist, who first painted some beautiful landscapes, was affected and touched by the slum life that he witnessed across the city of Mumbai and the poverty therein. The abject living conditions, dirty slums and poverty often cropped up in his paintings. However, Gade did not really abandon his passion for landscapes. He would travel quite frequently, traversing the deserts and palaces of Udaipur, Kerala’s lush greenery, and the dense forests elsewhere. <br><br>\r\nHis landscapes are a treasure to behold. He also did an exquisite series on monsoon greens. Hari Ambadas Gade passed away in 2001.\r\n",

Form his early childhood, the rooftops and alleyways of north Calcutta where he lived, the crumbling walls of buildings, the variety of people living there wove a certain magic in his mind. In 1963, he graduated from Indian College of Art and Draftsmanship. He began teaching at Indian College of Art and Draftsmanship in 1968. Later from 1973, Bhattacharjee began teaching at the Government College of Art & Craft and taught there till 1982. In 1964, he became a member of the Society of Contemporary Artists.\r\n\r\nBesides painting the city and its people that he knew so well, Bhattacharjee is also an accomplished portrait painter. Realism is Bhattacharjee's forte. In the process, he explores the possibilities of oil as a medium to the extent that he could depict the exact quality of drapery or the skin tone of a woman, the moldering walls of an old building as if by magic. Bhattacharjee has also worked extensively with pastel.",

      "Profile": "The sensitive artist was particularly moved by the struggles of rural and folk women, and they soon turned the core theme of her oeuvre. She started experimenting and over time, moved from modern abstract forms to rather decorative watercolors. Her quest for simplicity also drew her to oils with which she developed a style that was considered her trademark.<br><br>\r\nBorn in the village of Bela, near Nagpur in the state of Maharashtra in 1933, she studied at the Nagpur School of Art before arriving to Mumbai, and did her graduation from the Sir J. J. School of Art. There she happened to meet sculptor B. Vithal whom she later married.  B.Prabha’s inspiration was Amrita Shergil. <br><br>\r\nHer subject matter was spread over a wide array of themes like landscapes, social issues, homelessness etc.  ‘B. Prabha - From the Album’, a selection of works by the late artist, was on display at The Viewing Room, Mumbai, earlier this year. Charting out her career, an accompanying note mentioned: \"On her canvases, she immortalized the fisherwomen of Mumbai.B. Prabha’s graceful elongated figures of pensive rural women, with each canvas in a single dominant color still continue to mesmerize art lovers.<br><br>\r\nHer first exhibition, while she was still a student was the start of a long and successful career as three of her paintings were acquired by eminent Indian scientist Homi J. Bhabha. Since then, her works were shown in over 50 exhibitions in India and abroad. In 1993, her solo show ‘Shradhanjali’ in Mumbai was dedicated to her late husband B. Vithal. A significant aspect of the artist’s body of work was her effort to portray the plight of ubiquitous women in the Indian society.\r\n",

School of Art, Mumbai, in 1962. He started as a stage actor and designed stage sets. Later he joined the Weavers' Service Centre, Mumbai, as an art designer. He has held several solo shows in India and internationally, apart from participating in a number of group exhibitions. He has been Member of the Society of Contemporary Artists, Kolkata; the General Council, Lalit Kala Akademi, New Delhi and the Advisory Committee, National Gallery of Modern Art, New Delhi. He was awarded the Padma Shree in 1992. Known to be a modernist painter, his art confronts the viewer by a combination of the unexpected and the planned. His surreal landscapes, fecund and sensual, express libidinous imagery of part-bird-part-woman-part-vegetation; growing in and out of one another. His use of imagery is metamorphic.",

In its internationalist mood, this generation looked to the early 20th-century modernisms of Paris, London and Vienna for inspiration; its need to belong prompted an interest in the construction of a viable ‘Indian’ aesthetic that bore a dynamic relationship to an Indian identity. With Ram Kumar, this quest for an indigenist tenor has not meant a superficial inventory of ‘native’ motifs offered as evidence of a static and essentialist Indian identity. Instead, as I have already suggested, he demonstrates that a painter can enact the innermost dramas of his culture while maintaining the individuality, even idiosyncrasy of his performance. \r\nExcerpts from \"Parts of a World: Reflections on the Art of Ram Kumar\" by Ranjit Hoskote, 2002<br><br>\r\nRam Kumar lives and works from Delhi",

Subramanyan is among the few artists who have explored the possibilities of modern art from a different perspective, giving new dimensions to the human figure by making them appear more as characters from various myths and traditional narratives, populating a composition quite the contrary. As an artist he is extraordinarily versatile, cherishing the facility to work in diverse media, sizes, and techniques over a stylistic conformity to a single medium, genre, size, technique, and manner of visualization. The artist gave the human figure a new dimension. Drawing upon the rich resources of myth, memory and tradition, Subramanyan tempers romanticism with wit and eroticism. He has received the Kalidas Samman in 198 1, the Padma Shree in 1975, a D. Litt. (Honoris Causa) from the Rabindra Bharati University, Calcutta in 1992 and became a Fellow of Kerala Lalit Kala Akademi in 1993.",

Chowdhury went to Paris and studied in Ecole des Beaux Arts and in William Hayter's Atelier 17. He returned to Indian in early 1968 and went to Madras as a textile designer in the Handloom Board. He stayed there for four years till 1972. His first book of poems was published in 1970. The same year he joined the Calcutta Painters Group. In 1987, Chowdhury joined Kala Bhavan, Santiniketan as professor of painting. Besides his numerous activities, Chowdhury has written extensively on contemporary art. Always a powerful artist, Chowdhury developed his individual style after his return from France in the late '60s. The sinuous line contouring the flaccid figures, the crosshatching to achieve tonal variations distinguish C'howdhury's paintings which show men and women m enigmatic situations with provocative gestures placed in a dark dream- space. There is a bit of the theatre of the absurd.\r\n\r\nChowdhury lives and works in Sandniketan.",

He has once stated: “My heart and mind are filled with nature, at every moment.

In 1937 he reached Mumbai determined to become an artist, with hardly any money and lived m a cheap room in a by lane inhabited by pimps and prostitutes.

In its internationalist mood, this generation looked to the early 20th-century modernisms of Paris, London and Vienna for inspiration; its need to belong prompted an interest in the construction of a viable ‘Indian’ aesthetic that bore a dynamic relationship to an Indian identity. With Ram Kumar, this quest for an indigenist tenor has not meant a superficial inventory of ‘native’ motifs offered as evidence of a static and essentialist Indian identity. Instead, as I have already suggested, he demonstrates that a painter can enact the innermost dramas of his culture while maintaining the individuality, even idiosyncrasy of his performance. \r\nExcerpts from \"Parts of a World: Reflections on the Art of Ram Kumar\" by Ranjit Hoskote, 2002<br><br>\r\nRam Kumar lives and works from Delhi",

In August 1962, Swaminathan and some other artist founded the Group 1890, the mystifying number being the house number of Jayant and Jyoti Pandya at Bhavnagar. Painted with captivating simplicity his paintings explored the pictorial possibilities of his limited imagery which were emblematic of elements necessary for man's survival on earth and interpretatively the numerous permutations and combinations of the imagery and bright colours suggested the ascent of man's inner being leaving the gross and the sullied. He was a member of the International Jury of the Sao Paolo Biennale and served on the board of the Indian Council for Cultural Relations. He was also a trustee of the Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts, and in 198 1, the Government of Madhya Pradesh invited him to set up the art museum Roopanker at Bharat Bhavan, Bhopal.

      "Profile": "Born in Attingal, Kerela, in 1935, A Ramachandran did his M.A.(Malayalam Literature) from Kerala University (1954 -57) followed by a  Diploma in Fine Arts and Crafts, Kala Bhavan, Visva Bharati University, Santiniketan (1957-61), and later Ph. D. ('Mural Painting of Kerala') from Visva Bharati (1962 -65). The artist undertook a study tour of Japan in 1975 on Japan Foundation Grant. He moved to New Delhi By the mid-60s and joined the Jamia Milia Islamia in 1965 as a lecturer. He was attached to the university till 1992, and became honorary chairman of Kerala Lalit Kala Akademi in 1991.<br><br> \r\nInitially, A Ramachandran painted more in an expressionist style that was a poignant reflection of the angst of the prevailing urban life. The large-sized paintings, akin to murals, largely consisted of powerful figuration. His themes and style underwent a major change by the eighties. A tribal community based in Rajasthan with its vibrant lifestyle and ethos grabbed his imagination. Simultaneously, the forms and colours of the murals in the temples of Kerala greatly influenced his mode of expression. <br><br>\r\nAmong his selected solo exhibitions are  'Bahurupi', Vadehra Art Gallery, New Delhi (2009); a show courtesy Vadehra Art Gallery at Jehangir Art Gallery, Mumbai (2008); 'Recent Works', Grosvenor Vadehra, London (2008); ‘Face to Face’, Art Practice of A Ramachandran, The Guild Art Gallery, Mumbai and New York (2007-08); 'The Universe in the Lotus Pond', Vadehra Art Gallery, New Delhi; Birla Academy of Art and Culture, Kolkata (2006); Illustrations of ‘Gaudi’s Ocean’, exhibited at Nami Island, South Korea (2005); ‘Yayati’, Art Heritage, New Delhi (2002); ‘Icons of the Raw Earth, Part-I and II’, an exhibition of Bronze Sculptures and Drawings at Shridharani Gallery, New Delhi (1998);  ‘Puppet Theatre’, Dhoomimal Gallery, New Delhi (1981), and  ‘Retrospective’, organized by Kumar Gallery, New Delhi (1978).<br><br>\r\nApart from major retrospective exhibitions organized by Vadehra Art Gallery, National Gallery of Modern Art (NGMA), New Delhi (2003-04), by Kumar Gallery at Art Heritage, New Delhi and at Jehangir Art Gallery, Mumbai (1983), his work has been featured in many noteworthy group exhibitions like 'The Path of the Lotus: Indian Art', Grosvenor Gallery, London (2011); 'Natural Bodies, Subverted Canons', Vadehra Art Gallery (2011); 'Freedom to March: Rediscovering Gandhi through Dandi', presented by Ojas Art at Lalit Kala Akademi, New Delhi (2010); '10 x 10', Gallery Threshold, New Delhi (2010); 'Paper Trails', Vadehra Art Gallery (2010); 'The Living Insignia', Gallery Ensign, New Delhi (2010); and 'Progressive to Altermodern: 62 Years of Indian Modern Art', Grosvenor Gallery, London (2009), among others.\r\n<br><br>Among the important honours and awards won by him are Padma Bhushan, Government of India (2005); Raja Ravi Verma Puraskar, Government of Kerala (2003); Manaviyam Award, Manaviyam Cultural Mission, Government of Kerala (2001); Gagan – Abani Puraskar, Visva Bharati University (2000); Parishad Sanman, Sahitya Kala Parishad, New Delhi (1991); Noma Award for Children’s Picture Book Illustration (1980, 1978): and National Award for Painting, New Delhi (1973,69).",

In 1959, he received his diploma in drawing and painting.<br><br>In those early years, Pyne was greatly influenced by the brothers Abanindra nath and Gaganendra nath Tagore. He did water colours.Pyne has received many awards and is present in many public and private collections.<br><br> From water colour, Pyne turned to gouache and then tempera since the mid-'60s. It is from this time onwards that his figuration and palette also changed. A skeletal element was introduced into the figures while animal showed their fangs and claws. They were portrayed either as predators or victims. Dark shadows dominated his canvases offset with the use of a golden umber. Certain motifs surfaced repeatedly like boats, bits of bone, wood and other debris, dark doors and windows, birdman, Chaitanya, the leader of the Bhakti movements, animals, daggers, and so on. Most canvases reflected the opposing pulls of death and life eternal. Pyne's varied treatment of the eyes are worth note.<br><br>Pyne lives and works in Calcutta.",

His most recent shows have been ‘Yes, I am He’ organized by India Fine Art at Jehangir Art Gallery, Mumbai, in 2007; ‘Telangana: Inheritance of a Dream Lost’ at Art Alive, New Delhi, also in 2007; and ‘Mukham’ at Sanskriti Art Gallery, Kolkata, in 2006.<br><br>\r\nThota Vaikuntam hails from Andhra Pradesh, in South India, and finds his inspiration in the rural areas of the state.

      "Profile": "In 1960, at the age of twenty, Menon departed India to study art in Europe. There, she was influenced by her exposure to the techniques of the medieval Christian artists. While in Paris, she began to experiment with a muted palette of translucent colours,which she created by the repeated application of oil paint in thin glazes. Painting on hardboard, Menon enhanced the finely textured surface of her paintings by burnishing the finished work with a soft dry brush, creating a glow reminiscent of medieval icons. Menon utilized the characteristics of early Christian art--including the frontal perspective, the averted head, and the slight body elongation--but took the female nude as a frequent subject. The result is a dynamic relationship of eroticism and melancholy. Menon developed her iconography of distance and loss in her later works through her thematic depiction of black crows, empty chairs,windows, and hidden figures; with these paintings, she became internatinally established as an artist of note.<br><br> Yet, as Menon noted, \"when repeated often enough, a motif becomes a symbol which in turn becomes a cliché; a cliché becomes an absurdity, a cartoon\". Therefore in 1992, she staged an exhibit of household chairs, trunks and cupboards, all painted with images appropriated from her own paintings. This radical recontextualization of her work constituted a pre-emptive strike by Menon to \"remove art from its pedstal\". She continued the reimagination of her corpus in the \"Mutations\" of 1996. Menon manipulated images from her best-known paintings on a computer, and overpainted the print-outs with acrylics and oils. More recently, she embarked on a collaboration with Gayatri Rula to produce sculptures in Muranese glass. Menon created models in clay, which were cast in fibre glass and shaped into glass by the Italian craftspeople of Muran. The objects, ranging from figures of Krishna and Ganesha to bowls and plates, were currently on display at the Dome Gallery of the National Gallery of Modern Art, Mumbai.",

Shah remains a committed professional, true to his tools and occupational skills, manaically obsessed with every detail that concerns his technique, which he has developed and individualized to an extreme degree, along with aesthetic concepts and ideas that flow from his creative being. Though Shah is seen primarily as a sculptor, his initial training as a painter cannot be overlooked. Interestingly, in some of his works one can decipher his attempt to amalgamate the three - diamensional with the two - diamensional, creating in the process unique artworks. Individually each sculpture by Shah holds its own as an autonomous and independent art work. Himmat Shah was sent to gharshala in bhavnagar to study in a school affiliated to Dakshinamurti in Gujarat. Shah went on to enroll with the J.J School of Art Bombay, which he left to join the Faculty of Fine Arts in Baroda. The artist left Baroda for Delhi and since then there has been no looking back. His work can be found in several important collections all over the world and he has received several awards and scholarships in his 50yrs of work experience.",

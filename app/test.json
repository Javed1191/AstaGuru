    "Prdescription": "PHILATELY: A PASSION FOR POST STAMPS<br><br>Postage stamp which begun as a piece of paper in token of receipt of postage has gradually assumed additional functions. It is a channel\r\nthrough which one can commemorate, celebrate and promote national heritage and events. It is truly a statement of sovereignty of a nation. It\r\nframes national identity and carries an important message to both the outside world and the citizens of the country. Stamps are thus referred to as bearers of nationalist thoughts, beliefs and principles. The various facets of a stamp include it being used as a \u2018Token of Postage\u2019 and as a \u2018Cultural Ambassador\u2019.<br><br>FIRST DAY COVERS<br><br>First Day Covers are issued on the first day of availability of a new set of postage stamps. Thus the seminal collective is known as First Day Covers, these are stamped envelopes which were processed at the post office where the stamp was issued and has a cancellation indicating the same as well. The cancellation will often be specially designed for the occasion\r\nand will frequently state to the effect of \"First Day of Issue\u201d.<br><br>Collecting First Day Covers is a popular aspect of stamp collecting and has\r\na well-developed body of information and resources. One of the most well-known components of First Day Cover collecting are cachets.\r\nCachets are the artwork which is incorporated to the envelope, complementing the stamp subject. In addition to numerous commercial artists and firms that produce cachets, individual collectors also often design their own artwork. Holistically three elements are brought out together to create First Day Cover those being, \u2018There should be a cover official or private\u2019, \u2018Stamp or Stamps issued\u2019 and\u2018First Day Official cancellation postmark\u2019.

    "Prdescription": "The Order of British India was an order of merit which was presented by the British East India Company. It was established on 17 April 1837 and\r\nwas awarded to members of the British Indian Army for loyal and honourable service. After the Mutiny of 1857- 1858 got thwarted; the damaged East India Company and its Presidency Armies in British India came under the administrative authority of the British Empire. Consequently, the Order of British India was included as a part of the British honour system in the years 1859. The medal was originally introduced with three classes namely first, second and third. It was\r\nreduced to two classes when the Victoria Cross replaced the first class medal and was later reduced to a singular class in 1944. The recipients of the Medal of the first class were allowed to utilise the title Sardar Bahadur\r\n(heroic leader) and the recipients of second class were permitted to use the title Bahadur (hero). The receivers of both classes of medals also adopted the post-nominal letters \u2018OBI\u2019. A recipient technically needed to be in possession of the lower class before being awarded a higher class, although occasionally recipients were awarded the higher class if they performed more than one act of gallantry. The recipients of the order received increased pay and pension allowances and were very highly regarded. The order of merit was disused after the partition of India and the birth of the Republic of India in the year 1947.<br><br>Order of British India, First Class Type 2, neck badge, Gold and enamel, 37. 50g.

He is the youngest recipient to date and the first ever\r\nsportsperson to receive the same. Undoubtedly he is a talisman of Indian sportsmanship and has glorified the nation\u2019s prestige. A video footage of spectators and club members standing ovation to him when he walked out for the last time to play at the Lords stadium in England depicts the\r\nadulation he received not only in India but all over the world.",

    "Prdescription": "The Thrilla in Manila was the third and final boxing match between Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier. It took place on the 1st of October 1975\r\nfor the heavyweight championship of the world at the Philippine Coliseum in Cubao, Quezon City, Philippines. The venue was renamed from Araneta Coliseum, specifically for the match. Ali won by technical knockout (TKO) after Frazier's chief second, Eddie Futch, conceded the fight prior to the 15th round. The contest's name is derived from the frequent rhyming boast made by Ali that the fight would be a \"killa and a thrilla and a chilla, when I get that gorilla in Manila.\" The bout is consistently ranked as one of the best in the sport's history and was the culmination of a three-bout rivalry between the two fighters that Ali won, 2\u20131.<BR><BR>This lot brings back the memories of one of the greatest bouts in the\r\nhistory of boxing. It was a ruthless blow for the two, the entire 15 rounds of what was christened the \u201cThrilla in Manila\u201d one of the bloodiest and\r\nmost brutal fights to go down in boxing history. It was watched by 700 million people on television and almost 27,000 sweating in Araneta\r\nColiseum. By the 14th round of \"Thrilla in Manila\", Muhammad Ali made sure it was to be the last of the legendary fight by deploying thirty\r\ntremendous punches.",

    "Prdescription": "The Fight of the Century is the title boxing writers and historians have given to the boxing match between WBC/WBA heavyweight champion\r\nJoe Frazier (26\u20130, 23 KOs) and Ring magazine/lineal heavyweight champion Muhammad Ali (31\u20130, 25 KOs), which took place on the 8th of\r\nMarch 1971, at Madison Square Garden in New York City. Frazier won in 15 rounds via unanimous decision. It was the first time that two undefeated boxers fought each other for the heavyweight title.<BR><BR>On the evening of the match, Madison Square Garden had a circus-like\r\natmosphere, with scores of policemen to control the crowd. Countless celebrities, from Norman Mailer andWoody Allen to Frank Sinatra were in\r\nthe attendance. Artist LeRoy Neiman painted Ali and Frazier as they fought. Burt Lancaster served as a commentator for the closed-circuit broadcast. Though Lancaster had never performed as a sports commentator before, he was hired by the fight's promoter, Jerry Perenchio. The other commentators were play-by-play announcer Don\r\nDunphy and boxing champion Archie Moore.<BR><BR>The fight itself exceeded its promotional hype and went the full 15-round championship distance. Ali dominated the first three rounds, peppering the shorter Frazier with rapier-like jabs that raised welts on the champion's face. In the closing seconds of the round three, Frazier\r\nconnected with a tremendous hook to Ali's jaw, snapping his head back. Frazier began to dominate in the fourth round, catching Ali with several\r\nof his famed left hooks and pinning him against the ropes to deliver tremendous body blows.<BR><BR>At the end of round 14 Frazier held a lead on all three scorecards (by scores of 8\u20136\u20130, 10\u20134\u20130, and 8\u20136\u20130). Early in round 15, Frazier landed a\r\nleft hook that put Ali on his back. Ali, his jaw swollen grotesquely, got up from the blow quickly, and managed to stay on his feet for the rest of the round despite several terrific blows from Frazier. A few minutes later the\r\njudges made it official: Frazier had retained the title with a unanimous decision, dealing Ali his first professional loss.",

    "Prdescription": "Edson Arantes do Nascimento was born on the 23rd of October 1940. Known as Pele, he is a retired Brazilian professional footballer who played\r\nas a forward. He is widely regarded as the greatest player of all time. Pele has been credited for connecting the phrase \"The Beautiful Game\" with football. In 1999, he was voted World Player of the Century by the International Federation of Football History & Statistics (IFFHS). The same year, France Football asked their former Ballon d'Or winners to choose the\r\nFootball Player of the Century; they unanimously selected Pel\u00e9. In 1999, Pele was elected Athlete of the Century by the IOC and Time magazine\r\nincluded him in their list of 100 most influential people of the 20th century. In 2013 he received the FIFA Ballon d'Or Prix d'Honneur in recognition of his career and achievements as a global icon of football.<br><br>According to the IFFHS, Pele is the most successful league goal-scorer in the world, scoring 1281 goals in 1363 games, which included unofficial\r\nfriendlies and tour games. He was listed in the Guinness World Records for most career goals scored in football for this. During his playing days, Pele was for a period the highest paid athlete in the world. In Brazil, he is\r\nhailed as a national hero for his accomplishments in football and for his outspoken support of policies that improve the social conditions of the poor. In 1961, Brazil President J\u00e2nio Quadros had Pele declared a national treasure. During his career, he became known as \"The Black Pearl\" (A\r\nP\u00e9rola Negra), \"The King of Football\" (O Rei do Futebol), \"The King Pel\u00e9\" (O Rei Pele) or simply \"The King\" (O Rei).<br><br>Pele began playing for Santos at age 15 and the Brazil national football\r\nteam at 16. During his international career, he won three FIFA World Cups: 1958, 1962 and 1970, being the only player ever to do so. Pele is\r\nthe all-time leading goalscorer for Brazil with 77 goals in 91 games. At club level he is also the record goalscorer for Santos, and led them to the 1962 and 1963 Copa Libertadores. Pel\u00e9's \"electrifying play and penchant for spectacular goals\" made him a star around the world, and his club team Santos toured internationally in order to take full advantage of his popularity. Since retiring in 1977, Pel\u00e9 has been a worldwide ambassador for football and has made many acting and commercial ventures. In 2010, he was named the Honorary President of the New York Cosmos.",

Two good feet. Magic in the air. Quick. Powerful. Could beat people with skill. Could outrun people. Only five feet and eight inches tall, yet he seemed a giant\r\nof an athlete on the pitch. Perfect balance and impossible vision. He was the greatest because he could do anything and everything on a football\r\npitch. I remember Saldhana the coach being asked by a Brazilian journalist who was the best goalkeeper in his squad. He said Pele. The\r\nman could play in any position\". Former Manchester United striker and member of England's 1966 FIFA World Cup-winning team Sir Bobby\r\nCharlton stated; \"I sometimes feel as though football was invented for this magical player.\u201d",

The number 10 jersey has now become synonymous with Barcelona\u2019s Lionel Messi. The Argentine forward wears the number\r\nfor both his club and country. Leo Messi started his senior career at Barcelona with the number 30. He had scored his first ever senior goal\r\nwith that kit before switching to number 19 when he became a regular. By the start of the 2008/09 season Brazilian doyen Ronaldinho had left\r\nthe club and Messi was given the iconic shirt. The rest is history, Messi has broken innumerable goal scoring records and has won every club trophy available at least thrice playing for F C Barcelona. Having scored more than 400 goals for the Catalan club since his breakthrough in 2004/05, Messi has won the prestigious Ballon d\u2019Or four times.<BR><BR>When Ronaldinho\u2019s career was on the decline and Barcelona\u2019s team was\r\nout of form having not secured a single trophyin 2007/08, the club decided to let go of Ronaldinho. Messi has always maintained that\r\nRonaldinho had helped his transition into the first team with ease. \u201cHe [Ronaldinho] was a great help,\u201d Messi had said. \u201cIt\u2019s never easy to go into a changing room at the age of 16 especially with my character.\u201dIn an interview with BarcaTV, Messi reveals how Ronaldinho had asked him to take his number before he left Camp Nou. \"Before leaving the club [Ronaldinho] was coming off a few months where he was thinking about things,\u201d Messi explained.\u201cHe had it on his mind that he was leaving and he told me to have his number. I took it without looking at what he had done with the shirt. If I did, I would not have taken it.\u201dRonaldinho and Messi have always shared a great friendship since their playing days. It was Ronaldinho who assisted Messi\u2019s debut goal in La Liga.",

    "Prdescription": "Lionel Andr\u00e9s \"Leo\" Messi was born on the 24th of June 1987 is an Argentine professional footballer who plays as a forward for Spanish club\r\nFC Barcelona and captains the Argentina national team. Often considered the best player in the world and rated by many in the sport as the greatest of all time, Messi is the only football player in history to win five FIFA Ballons d'Or, four of which he won consecutively and was the first player to win three European Golden Shoes.With Barcelona he has won eight La\r\nLiga titles and four UEFA Champions League titles, as well as six Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a titles, four Copas del Rey, three UEFA Super Cups\r\nand three FIFA ClubWorld Cups. Both a prolific goalscorer and a creative playmaker, Messi holds the records for most goals scored in La Liga, a La Liga season (50), a football season (73) and a calendar year (91), as well as the most goals in the Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a (12) and most goals in El\r\nCl\u00e1sico (21) and also those for most assists made in La Liga and the Copa Am\u00e9rica. He has scored over 500 senior career goals for club and country, making him the 10th most prolific goal scorer of all time.<br><br>Born and raised in central Argentina, Messi was diagnosed with a growth hormone deficiency as a child. At age 13, he relocated to Spain to join\r\nBarcelona, who agreed to pay for his medical treatment. After a fast progression through Barcelona's youth academy, Messi made his\r\ncompetitive debut aged 17 in October 2004. Despite being injury-prone during his early career, he established himself as an integral player for the club within the next three years, finishing 2007 as a finalist for both the\r\nBallon d'Or and FIFA World Player of the Year award, a feat he repeated the following year. His first uninterrupted campaign came in the 2008\u201309\r\nseason, during which he helped Barcelona achieve the first treble in Spanish football. At 22 years old, Messi won the Ballon d'Or and FIFA\r\nWorld Player of the Year award by record voting margins.<br><br>Three successful seasons followed, with Messi winning three consecutive\r\nFIFA Ballons d'Or, including an unprecedented fourth. His personal best campaign to date was the 2011\u201312 season, in which he set the La Liga\r\nand European records for most goals scored in a single season, while establishing himself as Barcelona's all-time top scorer in official\r\ncompetitions in March 2012. He again struggled with injury during the following two seasons, twice finishing second for the Ballon d'Or behind\r\nCristiano Ronaldo, his perceived career rival. Messi regained his best form during the 2014\u201315 campaign, breaking the all-time goalscoring records in both La Liga and the Champions League in November 2014 and led Barcelona to a historic second treble.<br><br>An Argentine international, Messi is his country's all-time leading goal\r\nscorer, with 57 international goals. At youth level, he won the 2005 FIFA World Youth Championship, finishing the tournament with both the Golden Ball and Golden Shoe, and an Olympic gold medal at the 2008 Summer Olympics. His style of play as a diminutive, left-footed dribbler\r\ndrew comparisons with compatriot Diego Maradona, who declared the teenager his successor. After making his senior debut in August 2005,\r\nMessi became the youngest Argentine to play and score in a FIFA World Cup during the 2006 edition and reached the final of the 2007 Copa America, where he was named young player of the tournament. As the squad's captain from August 2011, he led Argentina to three consecutive\r\nfinals: the 2014 World Cup, for which he won the Golden Ball, the 2015 and the 2016 Copas America.",

    "Prdescription": "Michael Jeffrey Jordan was born on the 17th of February 1963. He is an American retired professional basketball player, businessman and\r\nprincipal owner and chairman of the Charlotte Hornets. Jordan played 15 seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA) for the Chicago Bulls and Washington Wizards. His biography on the NBA website states: By acclamation, Michael Jordan is the greatest basketball player of all time. Jordan was one of the most effectively\r\nmarketed athletes of his generation and was considered instrumental in popularizing the NBA around the world in the 1980s and 1990s.<BR><BR>Jordan joined the NBA's Chicago Bulls in 1984 as the third overall draft pick. He quickly emerged as a league star, entertaining crowds\r\nwith his prolific scoring. His leaping ability, demonstrated by performing slam dunks from the free throw line in slam dunk contests, earned him the nicknames Air Jordan and His Airness. He\r\nalso gained a reputation for being one of the best defensive players in basketball. In 1991, he won his first NBA championship with the\r\nBulls, and followed that achievement with titles in 1992 and 1993, securing a \"three-peat\". Although Jordan abruptly retired from\r\nbasketball before the beginning of the 1993 94 NBA season to pursue a new venture in minor league baseball, he returned to the Bulls in March 1995 and led them to three additional championships in 1996, 1997, and 1998, as well as a then-record 72 regular-season wins in the 1995 96 NBA season. Jordan retired for a second time in January 1999, but returned for two more NBA seasons from 2001 to 2003 as a member of the Wizards.<BR><BR>Jordan's individual accolades and accomplishments include five Most Valuable Player (MVP) Awards, ten All-NBA First Team designations, nine All-Defensive First Team honours, fourteen NBA All-Star Game appearances, three All-Star Game MVP Awards, ten scoring titles, three steals titles, six NBA Finals MVP Awards, and the 1988 NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award. Among his numerous accomplishments, Jordan holds the NBA records for highest career\r\nregular season scoring average (30.12 points per game) and highest career playoff scoring average (33.45 points per game). In 1999, he was named the greatest North American athlete of the 20th century by ESPN, and was second to Babe Ruth on the Associated Press's list of athletes of the century. Jordan is a two-time inductee into the\r\nBasketball Hall of Fame, having been enshrined in 2009 for his individual career, and again in 2010 as part of the group induction of the 1992 United States men's Olympic basketball team (\"The Dream\r\nTeam\"). He became a member of the FIBA Hall of Fame in 2015.",

<p>AstaGuru was conceptualised in the year 2008 functioning as a safe and secure platform to conduct online auctions for 'Contemporary & Modern Indian Art', as well as vintage collectibles and rear antiques such as sculptures, classic miniatures paintings, fine writing instruments, timepieces, celebrity memorabilia and aristocratic jewelry. The word AstaGuru is a combination of Asta which means auction in Italian and Guru which indicates our mastery at conducting the same. With the world becoming whole on a digital level, we are able to showcase Indian Art & Antiques, hereby successfully linking the perspective buyer and consignor without any geographic constraints. Our stringent selection process ensures only prime artworks & exquisite antiques are part of our auctions. Numerous parameters such as the provenance of the work, the rarity of the work, and its physical condition are assessed before their inclusion in our auctions.
    Under the leadership of Mr Vickram Sethi, founder & chairman of The Arts Trust, Institute of Contemporary Indian Art Gallery, Mumbai & AstaGuru and Mr Tushar Sethi, CEO AstaGuru, we are treading towards a horizon filled with Art, Antiques & Bliss. Their keen eye and impeccable knowledge leverages us with insights of current & future trends. Our aim is to manifest Indian Art globally and create a conducive environment that spurts its growth.</p>

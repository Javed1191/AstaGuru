The seller contract covers two important issues that will affect your bottom line: the reserve price and AstaGuru's commissions.
<p>
Reserve price.
<p>
The reserve is the confidential minimum selling price to which a consignor (you) and AstaGuru agree before the sale - your property's "floor" price, below which no bid will be accepted. If bidding on your item fails to reach the reserve, we will not sell the piece and will advise you of your options. It is important to consider the reserve price in light of the fact that AstaGuru will assess fees and handling costs for unsold lots.
<p>
Seller's commission.
<p>
Sellers pay a commission that is deducted, along with any agreed-upon expenses, from the hammer price. Should you have any specific questions regarding the selling commission, please call the appropriate representative for more information.</body>
